# Class Management App

Classroom Management App (Flutter)
This is a simple classroom management mobile application built using Flutter.
The app is made to help teachers, CRs, and students stay updated with daily class routines and any class changes.
Students often forget class schedules or miss updates like class time changes or room changes.
This app solves that problem by showing the daily routine clearly and sending instant notifications whenever an update is made.
1.	What this app does
2.	Shows daily class routine for students
3.	Teachers manage class schedules
4.	CR (Class Representative) can update class information on teacher’s instruction
5.	Teachers or CRs can change:
a.	Class time
b.	Classroom number
6.	Students receive instant notifications
7.	The app always shows the latest updated routine
# Why we are building this
We are building this project to solve a common problem faced by students and teachers — missing or confusing class routine updates.
Class time or room changes are often shared verbally or in group chats, which many students miss.
This app is being built as a simple and practical solution where daily class routines are always visible, and any change is instantly notified to everyone.
This idea can be useful for schools, colleges, and coaching centers.
